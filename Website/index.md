### Hi, I'm Joseph Tooby-Smith
_Postdoctoral researcher in computer science at Reykjavik University_



My current research revolves around the functional programming language Lean 4. I am working on a project to digitalise results from high energy physics in Lean 4. More details about this project, called HepLean.

I'd love more people to get involved in this program - if you would like to feel free to get in touch, or make a pull-request to that repository.
