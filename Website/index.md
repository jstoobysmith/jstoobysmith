### Hi, I'm Joseph Tooby-Smith
_Postdoctoral researcher in computer science at Reykjavik University_

My research explores the connection between computer science and physics. 
In particular, I am interested in how proof assistants like Lean 4 can be used 
effectively in the physical sciences. 

To this end, I have developed a program called [HepLean](https://github.com/HEPLean/HepLean). 
I'd love more people to get involved in this program - so please get in touch if you are interested!
