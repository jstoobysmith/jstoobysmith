# Future Projects

My research agenda is: 

_To explore and promote the use of proof assistants in the physical sciences._

The future projects listed below aim to overcome some challenges associated with this 
research agenda. 

If you would like to collaborate on or join any of these projects, please get in touch.
Students are particularly encouraged to reach out!

## Experimental data 
Inclusion of experimental data into a proof assistant, and allowing the manipulation of 
    experimental data in conjunction with formal proof statements. This is related 
    to the use of computer algebra systems within Lean. 

## Informalising physics theorems
To develop an AI, or to fine-tune one, 
    that writes and improves doc-strings for physics definitions and lemmas. The aim would be 
    to write good doc-strings for all lemmas and results within HepLean. 

## Papers and notes from Lean 
I want to make an interface that allows one to write papers and notes 
    within Lean, that look how we expect _e.g._ a physics paper looks. 

## Biology 
As an example of using Lean in the bilological sciences, I would like 
    to formalize the notation of a phylogenetic tree. This could be taken to further to more 
    concepts within the biological sciences. 

## Tactics to deal with index notation 

HepLean currently contains an implementation of index 
    notation, creating automated tactics will allow us to work more easily with this notation.

## Dirac deltas 
The phycisists use of Dirac delta 'functions' is very liberal. This project would determine 
    the best way for phycisists to use Dirac delta in a formal proof assistant and develop 
    the best technology to enable this to happen. 

## Feynman diagrams (currently in progress)
I want to formalize Feynman diagrams in Lean, and this project is currently 
    in progress. This will demonstrate the use of computation in Lean and how it can be used 
    to help theorem proving. 
    One of the challanges here is dealing with the Dirac delta functions which appear 
    in physics expressions.
