### Hi, I'm Joseph Tooby-Smith
_Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in computer science at University of Bath_

_contact me at_: <span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override; direction: rtl;">ku.ca.<!--comemfslj-->htab@4184sj</span>

(If you email me and I don't respond in about 3 days, feel free to follow up.)

I started my academic career as a high-energy physicist, but have since moved over
to computer science.  Back in my high-energy physics days, I used to work
on higher categories and how they could be applied and used in physics.
Now I'm part of the Mathematical Foundations group at the University of Bath,
and I research interactive theorem provers and their use in the physical sciences.
Interactive theorem provers are computer langauges that allow you to write
definitions, and theorems and their proofs, in a way such that
mathematical correctness is guaranteed.
In particular, I am a maintainer of the project  [PhysLean](physlean.com) (something
which I started).
