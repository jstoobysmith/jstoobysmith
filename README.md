## About me
|   | Institution             | |
|---------|-------------------------|---------|
| Lecturer | University of Bath | Working on the formalization of physics.
| Postdoc | Reykjavik University      | Worked on the formalization of physics.
| Postdoc | Cornell University      | Started a program to digitalise results from high energy physics into Lean 4. Also, continued use of higher category theory in physics by studying generalized symmetries.
| PhD     | University of Cambridge | Supervised by Ben Gripaios. PhD in theoretical physics. Thesis focused on the application of techniques in mathematics to solve problems in physics. Including the use of number theory, category theory and geometry.
| Masters | University of Oxford    | Integrated masters in mathematical and theoretical physics. Top of year in third, and fourth years.
