### Hi, I'm Joseph Tooby-Smith
_Lecturer (Assistant Profesor) in computer science at University of Bath_

_contact me at_: <span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override; direction: rtl;">ku.ca.<!--comemfslj-->htab@4184sj</span>


My research explores the connection between computer science and physics,
and how we can improve the quality and storage of results from the physical sciences.
In particular, I am interested in how proof assistants like Lean 4 can be used
effectively in the physical sciences.

To this end, I have developed a program called [PhysLean](physlean.com).
I'd love more people to get involved in this program - so please get in touch if you are interested!
