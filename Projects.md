# Future Projects

My research agenda is: 

_To explore and promote the use of proof assistants in the physical sciences._

The future projects listed below aim to overcome some challenges associated with this 
research agenda. 

If you would like to collaborate on or join any of these projects, please get in touch.
Students are particularly encouraged to reach out!

- **Experimental data** Inclusion of experimental data into a proof assistant, and allowing the manipulation of 
    experimental data in conjunction with formal proof statements. This is related 
    to the use of computer algebra systems within Lean. 
- **Physics theorem informalization** To develop an AI, or to fine-tune one, 
    that writes and improves doc-strings for physics definitions and lemmas. The aim would be 
    to write good doc-strings for all lemmas and results within HepLean. 
- **Lean papers and notes** I want to make an interface that allows one to write papers and notes 
    within Lean, that look how we expect _e.g._ a physics paper looks. 
- **Phylogenetic tree** As an example of using Lean in the bilological sciences, I would like 
    to formalize the notation of a phylogenetic tree. This could be taken to further to more 
    concepts within the biological sciences. 
- **Tactics to deal with index notation** HepLean currently contains an implementation of index 
    notation, creating automated tactics will allow us to work more easily with this notation.
